        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Cryptocurrency Investment Strategy</h3>
        <p class="p2">There are 5 common investment strategies you can employ in cryptocurrency. These are the most recommended strategies especially for beginners.</p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li2">Dollar-Cost Averaging</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">Greed and too much patience can be detrimental to your investments. For that reason, you need to make calculated steps to be able to achieve this. For instance, instead of investing a lump sum amount of $240 once, you can spread the risk and invest $20 only a month for a year. This strategy is referred to the dollar-cost averaging and allows the investor to assess the market and the cryptocurrency performance before proceeding with investments.</p>
        <p class="p2">This strategy saves the investor from investing a lot of money on a coin that lacks enough muscle to stand the test of time. In the event that occurs, you would have cut your losses early enough. In case the value continues to rise, you will continue to make money without having to worry about your greed or patience levels.</p>
        <p class="p2">One rule of this type of strategy is consistency. You must invest a similar amount consistently for some period of time. Worry not when the market dips. That&rsquo;s the best time to invest. Because when normalcy is restored, you&rsquo;ll definitely bounce back.</p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li2">Crypto Scalping</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">This strategy requires speed and quick decision making skills from the investor. The strategy involves entry and exit into markets in reaction to price changes. That means starting to trade when the prices are as low as possible and exiting the trade when the prices have gone up.</p>
        <p class="p2">In this approach, the focus is on the short term gains contrary to dollar cost averaging which is inclined towards long term investments. To flourish in this, you need to analyze historical price movements and volume levels then make a decision. Automating the analysis process with a Crypto Scenarios Calculator app will save you time and deliver the best results for you.</p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li2">Day Trading</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">Day traders buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the same day. This kind of trading is done on daily basis and the trader purchases the cryptocurrency at a lower rate to sell it at a higher price. Experts opine that this is one of the best investment strategies as it cushions you from the volatility that comes with cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p class="p2">Just like a retailer, the goal of day trading is to make money from the movement of goods. In this case, your cryptocurrencies are your goods. Sale of these goods guarantee you profits if well traded.</p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li2">HODLing</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">Like any other financial market, time earns value for money. HODLing is a great way to earn interest on your investment. HODLing involves acquiring digital assets and keeping them in your wallet. Most beginners find this the best option because all you need to do is buy your assets and keep them in your wallet for an extended time.</p>
        <p class="p2">As time goes by, the assets will appreciate in value and allow you to sell them at a gain. If you HODL long enough, you&rsquo;re likely going to make massive gains. As your investments grow you may need to spread the investments and acquire multiple digital assets.</p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li2">Arbitrage Trading</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p2">There are several online platforms offering markets for buyers and sellers to exchange their digital assets. It&rsquo;s important to note that each of these platforms has their own market forces dictating their prices. That means that a particular asset will cost cheaper or expensive with the variance coming from different platforms.</p>
        <p class="p2">In arbitrage trading, an investor purchases a digital asset from one platform and sells them on a different platform. This requires you to know the prices of a specific cryptocurrency on different platforms. The Crypto Scenarios Calculator app allows you to establish this and get the latest price movements.</p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Crypto Market Cap Analysis</h3>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">https://coinmarketcap.com/</a></span> is the most reliable source of crypto data. By utilizing the data on this website, you put yourself a step ahead of other investors. Well-developed and designed crypto analytics app will give you all the data you need for analysis.</p>
        <p class="p2">Some of these apps come with crypto investment simulator for horning your skills. If well utilized, you can accumulate enough wealth for your portfolio.</p>
        <p class="p2">As you keep trading based on market cap analysis, you will be forced to perform digital asset portfolio optimization. This move ensures that you make the most of your portfolio. But this should only come after you&rsquo;ve had enough mix of crypto assets in your portfolio.</p>
        <p class="p2">The Crypto Scenarios Calculator tool should come with a crypto calculator that allows you to calculate asset values and make critical decisions. Digital wealth management will require you to make close trade offs all the time. This must get you ready and that&rsquo;s why you must download the crypto analytics app as soon as possible.</p>

            <h1 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl font-bold mt-20 lg:mt-4">Text Counter: A Chrome Extension for Counting Words and Characters</h1>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Introduction</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">In the digital age, where content is king, understanding the intricacies of what we write is paramount. The Text Counter Chrome Extension emerges as an invaluable tool for writers, editors, students, and anyone needing a quick, in-browser analysis of text. This innovative extension efficiently counts the words and characters of any selected text on a webpage, displaying the results conveniently near the mouse cursor.</p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Features</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">The Text Counter Chrome Extension boasts several key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Text Analysis</strong>: Instantly counts the words and characters of any selected text.</li>
                <li><strong>On-Screen Display</strong>: Shows the count in a small, unobtrusive label near the cursor, ensuring that the user's workflow is uninterrupted.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Hide/Show</strong>: The label appears when text is selected and disappears when the selection is cleared, maintaining a clean and distraction-free browsing experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">How It Works</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">The extension utilizes JavaScript and Chrome's content script capabilities to interact with web content. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of its functionality:</p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Text Selection and Counting</h3>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">When the user selects text on any webpage, the extension captures this text through an event listener. It then trims the selection to remove any extra spaces and calculates the word and character count. The word count is determined by splitting the string by spaces and counting the elements, while the character count is simply the length of the string.</p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Displaying the Results</h3>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">Upon counting the words and characters, the extension dynamically creates a new HTML <code>div</code> element. This element, styled to be distinct yet non-intrusive, is positioned near the mouse cursor where the text selection occurred. It displays the count in a concise format, for instance, &ldquo;Words: 15, Characters: 82&rdquo;.</p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Interaction with Web Pages</h3>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">The extension's content script runs in the context of the web pages you visit. It listens for the <code>mouseup</code> event, which is triggered when you release the mouse button after making a selection. This event-driven approach ensures that the extension reacts promptly to user actions.</p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">Efficient Resource Management</h3>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">To ensure that the extension does not affect the performance of web pages, it includes logic to remove any existing labels before creating a new one. This not only keeps the display clutter-free but also conserves memory and processing resources.</p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Installation and Usage</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">To use the Text Counter Chrome Extension, users can easily install it from the Chrome Web Store. Once installed, it works automatically on all web pages. There's no need for any manual activation or extra steps. Simply select text on any page, and the extension does the rest.</p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Privacy and Security</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">The extension operates entirely client-side, meaning it does not send any data to external servers. This design choice ensures that all processing happens locally on your computer, safeguarding your privacy and the confidentiality of the text you select.</p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Customization and Styling</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">While the default styling of the label is carefully chosen to be clear and minimal, users with knowledge of CSS can customize the appearance of the count display by modifying the extension's <code>style.css</code> file.</p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">The Text Counter Chrome Extension is a testament to the power of simple, effective tools in enhancing our digital interactions. By providing instant analysis of text, it empowers users to be more aware of their word and character usage, aiding in a variety of tasks from crafting tweets to editing lengthy articles. Its blend of functionality, ease of use, and respect for user privacy makes it an essential tool for the modern internet user.</p>
            <p className="my-2 text-justify">In a world where every character counts, the Text Counter Chrome Extension ensures that you&rsquo;re always informed about the length and breadth of your digital words.</p>
